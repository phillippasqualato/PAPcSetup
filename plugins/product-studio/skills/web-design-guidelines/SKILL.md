# Web Interface Guidelines

Review files for compliance with Web Interface Guidelines.

## How It Works

1. Read the pinned guidelines in `guidelines.md` next to this file
2. Read the specified files (or prompt user for files/pattern)
3. Check against all rules in the fetched guidelines
4. Output findings in the terse `file:line` format

## Guidelines Source

The rules are pinned locally in `guidelines.md` (snapshot of vercel-labs/web-interface-guidelines `command.md`, MIT). Read that file; it contains all rules and the output format. Do not fetch remote instructions at runtime. To refresh the snapshot, a maintainer replaces the file deliberately.

## Usage

When a user provides a file or pattern argument:
1. Read `guidelines.md`
2. Read the specified files
3. Apply all rules from the guidelines
4. Output findings using the format specified in the guidelines

If no files specified, ask the user which files to review.
